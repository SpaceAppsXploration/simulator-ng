simulator-ng
===========

## What's that?

This a POC app for Project Chronos Platform.

This is a Python3 [Tornado](https://github.com/tornadoweb/tornado) Web-server to run [sockjs](https://github.com/sockjs/sockjs-client) with [sockjs-tornado](https://github.com/mrjoes/sockjs-tornado).<br/>
The data is fetched from [Chronos cloudService](https://github.com/SpaceAppsXploration/cloudService) at [http://spacexplore.it](http://www.spacexplore.it).<br/>
The app is the Angular-js one in [/static/app](https://github.com/SpaceAppsXploration/simulator-ng/tree/master/static/app).

## To Do

*Improve Errors display to users (now it is done with alert())<br>
*~~Write a brief tutorial~~<br>
*Write hints for hovers<br>
*Limit possible choices in bus and payloads (3/4)<br>
*Implement loaders<br>
*Implement promises<br>
*Write utilities' functions to handle controllers' common tasks <br>
*Fix the pages navigation system (pages should keep selections) <br>
*~~Have all DOM manipulations into directives~~<br>
*~~Implement [JSON-RPC](http://www.jsonrpc.org/specification) spec for client-server communications~~ <br>
*~~Refactor socket wrapper~~ <br>
*Solve the double-binding for checkboxes groups in Payloads and Bus controllers <br>
*Better Details visualization in Results' Page

Notes: $routeProvider > resolve can be found in $route.current.locals<br>
Use $scope.bind('<mouseevent>') in directives to trigger events


## Installation


You need `npm` and `bower` to install client-side libraries and tests, and `angularjs` itself.
`python3-devel` libray needs to be installed in your system 

To run the server locally:

* Install MongoDB by following the installation instructions at [official website](http://docs.mongodb.org/manual/installation/)

* Create a virtual environment: `pyvenv-3.3 {/path/to/your/venv}`

* Activate your venv: `source {/path/to/your/venv}/bin/activate`

* Install dependencies into the venv: 

        easy_install pip
        pip install -r requirements.txt

* Clone repository: `git clone https://github.com/SpaceAppsXploration/simulator-ng`

        cd simulator-ng/static
        npm install
        bower install

* Start local MongoDB instance
 
        mongod
        
* Create a fake user by running `appdata/starter.py`

        python3.3 starter.py

* Start local server, in simulator-ng directory:

        nohup python3.3 astroloop.py &

Check if working: go to [localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080) in your browser
